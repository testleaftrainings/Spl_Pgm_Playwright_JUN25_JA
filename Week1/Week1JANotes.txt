Hoisting is JavaScript mechanism where the variable and named function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during the compile phase , before the code is executed.

1. Function declaration are fully hoisted.
2. var variables are hoisted but initilized to undefined.
3. let and const variables are hoisted but remain in TDZ Temporal Dead Zone.

Q2. What is the difference between var, let, and const in terms of scoping and hoisting.

var is function scoped and hoisted with undefined.
let and const are block scoped but not initilized(temporal dead zone).

Q3. What is Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript?
TDZ is a phase between entering a scope and the actual declaration where accesing a let and const throws reference error.


Q4. How does trim() improve reliability in form input automation?

const name = " Ravi "
const trimmedName = name.trim()

Q5. When would you use replaceAll() in test Automation?

const displayPrice = await page.textContent('#price');  //Rs 1,000
cont expectedPrice = "1000";

const cleanedPrice = displayPrice.replaceAll("Rs","").replaceAll(",","");

expect((cleanedPrice).toBe(expectedPrice)); 

Q6.What is the differen between == and === in JavScript ? Give example where == returns true but === returns false?

'5'==5; //true ('5' of datatype string is coerced to number datatype 5 )
'5'===5;//false (string!=number)

0==false; //true ( type coercion : false becomes 0)
0===false; // false (number!=boolean)

Q7. replace()

const Originalurl ="http://leaftaps.com/opentaps/control/login"

replace login with main 

const Expectedurl ="http://leaftaps.com/opentaps/control/main"

Q8 print login and opentaps from the below url:

const Originalurl ="http://leaftaps.com/opentaps/control/login"
